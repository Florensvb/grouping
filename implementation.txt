Linearly:
  > Assign to groups linearly
    > How to decide on group size -> via fixed constructor parameter? OK
    > How to choose K? -> good for discussion, lots of literature about how to find K
  > Perform DH within each group
    > How to do DH on Ethereum??

Randomly:
  > Assign to groups randomly
    > Which sources of randomness?
      > Last block hash -> Miners
      > Timestamp -> Miners
      > Seed from deployer -> Influenced by deployer
      > Oracle -> Centralized, WolframAlpha, Provable
      > RANDAO? -> Doesn't seem to be plug-and-play -> nothing else than commit/reveal -> password hash

Intersecting:

  > Not focus for now
